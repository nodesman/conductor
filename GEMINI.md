# Guiding Principles

This project is an opinionated workflow engine for guiding AI in software engineering. Its purpose is to establish a set of conventions—"the rails"—for interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM) to solve common development tasks.

It guides the entire process, from providing initial context and checklists to suggesting when and how to seek more knowledge. The core mission is to **build the rails for AI-guided development**.
