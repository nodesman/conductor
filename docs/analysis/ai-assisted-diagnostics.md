**Epic:** `AI-Assisted Diagnostics`
**Status:** `Verified`
**Verification Date:** `2025-08-08`

## 1. Problem Statement

*A concise, one-sentence summary of the user story or problem to be solved.*

> As a developer using Conductor, I want a way to get a second opinion from a different AI model (like GPT-5) when Gemini is stuck, so that I can avoid getting into unproductive loops.

## 2. AI-Powered Analysis Checklist

*Instructions for AI: You must critically evaluate the problem statement against each of the following criteria. For each item, provide a brief (1-2 sentence) justification for your "Yes" or "No" answer. Your analysis must be skeptical and thorough.*

- **[X] Is the problem's value proposition clear and compelling?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. Getting stuck in an AI feedback loop is a significant waste of time. Providing a structured "escape hatch" directly addresses this pain point and increases developer productivity.

- **[X] Is this the simplest possible solution to the problem?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. A direct `curl` command embedded in the workflow instructions is extremely simple. It avoids adding complex abstractions, new dependencies, or a dedicated CLI command, relying instead on a universal tool (`curl`) and clear instructions.

- **[X] Have potential alternatives been adequately explored?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. An alternative was a dedicated `--diagnose` command. This was rejected because it added unnecessary complexity to the tool itself, when a simple, direct instruction to the AI to use `run_shell_command` is more flexible and aligns with the tool's philosophy of guiding, not hiding.

- **[X] Does this feature align with the project's overall goals?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. The project's core mission is to "build the rails for AI-guided development." This feature is a perfect example of a "rail" that guides the AI into a more robust problem-solving process when it encounters a roadblock.

- **[X] Are the acceptance criteria well-defined and testable?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. The criteria are clear: the AI must recognize when it is stuck, formulate a prompt for the second AI, execute the provided `curl` command, and analyze the output. This can be verified by observing the AI's behavior in a real-world scenario.

## 3. Explored Alternatives

*A brief summary of other potential solutions that were considered and why they were not chosen.*

1.  **Alternative A: Dedicated `--diagnose` command**
    - **Description:** A new CLI command (`conductor --diagnose`) that would generate the `curl` prompt.
    - **Reason for Rejection:** This added unnecessary surface area to the CLI. The same outcome can be achieved more directly by instructing the AI within its main prompt, which is simpler and more aligned with the "prompt-first" philosophy of the tool.

## 4. Final Verification

*Instructions for AI: After completing the analysis above, if and only if all checklist items are marked "Yes", change the status at the top of this document to `Verified` and set the verification date. Otherwise, leave it as `Unverified` and provide a summary of the outstanding issues below.*

**AI Verification Summary:** All checklist items have been successfully validated. The feature is well-defined, simple, and aligned with the project's goals. It is ready for implementation.
