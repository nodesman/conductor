# Analysis & Verification for: Enforce Verified Analysis for `add-story`

**Epic:** `Workflow Enforcement`
**Status:** `Verified`
**Verification Date:** `2025-08-08`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

*A concise, one-sentence summary of the user story or problem to be solved.*

> As a project lead, I want the 'add-story' command to fail if a corresponding, verified analysis document does not exist for the story, in order to enforce the new development process.

## 2. AI-Powered Analysis Checklist

*Instructions for AI: You must critically evaluate the problem statement against each of the following criteria. For each item, provide a brief (1-2 sentence) justification for your "Yes" or "No" answer. Your analysis must be skeptical and thorough.*

- **[X] Is the problem's value proposition clear and compelling?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. This feature provides the enforcement mechanism for the entire analysis process. Without it, the process is merely a suggestion; with it, the process becomes a mandatory and effective quality gate.

- **[X] Is this the simplest possible solution to the problem?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. The simplest solution is to have the `add-story` command perform a file check. It will look for a corresponding `docs/analysis/*.md` file and check for the string "Status: `Verified`" before proceeding.

- **[X] Have potential alternatives been adequately explored?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. An alternative would be to have a separate `verify-story` command that updates a central registry. This is overly complex compared to simply checking for the existence and status of a file, which is transparent and requires no central database.

- **[X] Does this feature align with the project's overall goals?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. This feature is the final, crucial step in operationalizing the "Backlog Refinement" process. It directly supports the core mission of building strong "rails" for AI-guided development.

- **[X] Are the acceptance criteria well-defined and testable?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. The criteria are straightforward: 1. Running `add-story` for a story without an analysis file should fail with an error. 2. Running it for a story with an `Unverified` file should fail. 3. Running it for a story with a `Verified` file should succeed.

## 3. Explored Alternatives

*A brief summary of other potential solutions that were considered and why they were not chosen.*

1.  **Alternative A: Central Verification Registry**
    - **Description:** A central file (e.g., a JSON or YAML file) would keep track of all verified stories.
    - **Reason for Rejection:** This adds a layer of indirection and a potential source of merge conflicts. Keeping the verification status within the analysis document itself is more decentralized and robust.

## 4. Final Verification

*Instructions for AI: After completing the analysis above, if and only if all checklist items are marked "Yes", change the status at the top of this document to `Verified` and set the verification date. Otherwise, leave it as `Unverified` and provide a summary of the outstanding issues below.*

**AI Verification Summary:** All checklist items are validated. The feature is a necessary enforcement mechanism for the project's core workflow. It is ready for development.
