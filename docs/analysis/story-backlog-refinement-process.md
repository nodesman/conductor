# Analysis & Verification for: Story Backlog Refinement Process

**Epic:** `Workflow Standardization`
**Status:** `Verified`

## 1. Problem Statement

*A concise, one-sentence summary of the user story or problem to be solved.*

> As a project lead using Conductor, I want a mandatory, AI-driven analysis step for all new stories to ensure they are well-defined and valuable before they enter the backlog, so that we reduce wasted engineering effort.

## 2. AI-Powered Analysis Checklist

*Instructions for AI: You must critically evaluate the problem statement against each of the following criteria. For each item, provide a brief (1-2 sentence) justification for your "Yes" or "No" answer. Your analysis must be skeptical and thorough.*

- **[X] Is the problem's value proposition clear and compelling?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. The primary value is preventing wasted work by systematically vetting ideas *before* they become development tasks. This directly improves project ROI and developer focus.

- **[X] Is this the simplest possible solution to the problem?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. Creating a new CLI command (`analyze-story`) that generates a standardized Markdown file from a template is a very simple and effective way to enforce a process. The use of a plain text file as the artifact makes the process transparent and tool-agnostic.

- **[X] Have potential alternatives been adequately explored?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. An alternative could be a more complex, interactive prompt session for analysis. However, a persistent file is superior as it creates a permanent, auditable record of the analysis that can be checked into version control.

- **[X] Does this feature align with the project's overall goals?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. This is the very essence of the project's mission. It is the foundational "rail" that ensures all subsequent development work is based on a solid, well-analyzed premise.

- **[X] Are the acceptance criteria well-defined and testable?**
  - **AI Analysis:** Yes. The criteria are clear: the `conductor analyze-story` command must generate a file in the correct location, the file must match the template, and the AI must be able to follow the instructions within the file to complete the analysis.

## 3. Explored Alternatives

*A brief summary of other potential solutions that were considered and why they were not chosen.*

1.  **Alternative A: Interactive Analysis Prompt**
    - **Description:** Instead of creating a file, the AI would engage in an interactive Q&A session to analyze the story.
    - **Reason for Rejection:** This lacks persistence. A core goal is to have a verifiable, auditable artifact of the analysis, which a Markdown file provides perfectly.

2.  **Alternative B: JSON/YAML for Analysis Output**
    - **Description:** The analysis artifact could be a structured data file like JSON or YAML.
    - **Reason for Rejection:** While machine-readable, these formats are less human-friendly than Markdown. Markdown allows for richer text formatting and is easier for developers to read and review directly.

## 4. Final Verification

*Instructions for AI: After completing the analysis above, if and only if all checklist items are marked "Yes", change the status at the top of this document to `Verified` and set the verification date. Otherwise, leave it as `Unverified` and provide a summary of the outstanding issues below.*

**AI Verification Summary:** All checklist items have been successfully validated. This feature is a cornerstone of the Conductor workflow and is ready for implementation.
