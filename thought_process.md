## Task: [Implement `conductor --contextualize` feature](docs/features/01_contextualize.md)

**Analysis (following the protocol):**
*   **Critique:** This feature is essential. It directly addresses the core problem of AI lacking codebase context, as identified in the article. The proposed solution of reading files and prepending them to a prompt is a direct and effective way to solve this. No simpler alternative exists for this specific problem.
*   **Context:** I will read `src/conductor.ts` to understand the existing argument parsing. I will also re-read `docs/features/01_contextualize.md` to ensure the generated prompt perfectly matches the specification.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Modify `src/conductor.ts` to implement the `--contextualize` command logic.
    2.  The script will identify all arguments between the `--contextualize` command and the final argument. These will be treated as file paths.
    3.  The final argument will be treated as the user's core request.
    4.  The script will read each file, handling potential read errors gracefully.
    5.  It will then construct the final prompt by assembling the introductory text, the file contents, the analysis instructions, and the user's core request, exactly as defined in the feature documentation.
    6.  The complete prompt will be printed to standard output.
*   **Refinement:** After implementation, I will test the command with various inputs (e.g., one file, multiple files, non-existent files) to ensure the output is always correct and robust.

This plan outlines the steps to implement the `--contextualize` feature. Does this approach meet your approval?

## Task: Analyze 'No, AI is not Making Engineers 10x as Productive' article and create actionable tasks.

**Analysis:** The user wants to use the provided article as a guide for this project. The core goal is to build a CLI tool that generates prompts for the Gemini CLI. These prompts should be designed to counteract the problems described in the article, such as AI's lack of context, the tendency to encourage hasty work, and the failure to prevent unnecessary tasks.

**Plan (Step 1): Document Project Scope**
1.  Create a `README.md` file that clearly defines the project's mission: to be a CLI tool for generating sophisticated, context-aware prompts that help engineers use AI more thoughtfully and effectively.
2.  Present the `README.md` to the user for validation.

**Plan (Step 2): Deconstruct the Article into Actionable Themes**
1.  Identify the key problems from the article (e.g., "AI lacks codebase context," "AI encourages over-building").
2.  For each problem, brainstorm a corresponding "prompt-generating feature" for our CLI tool. For instance, a feature to generate a prompt that forces the AI to critique a proposed solution before building it.
3.  Present these themes and feature ideas to the user for feedback.

**Plan (Step 3): Populate the Kanban Board**
1.  Once the feature ideas are approved, create new tasks for each one and add them to the "To Do" column in `project_kanban.md`.
