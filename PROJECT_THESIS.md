# Project Thesis & Future Epics

This document outlines the long-term vision and potential future directions for the Gemini Prompt Scaffolding CLI.

## Core Thesis

The fundamental bottleneck in software development is not the speed of typing code, but the quality of the thinking that precedes it. This tool is founded on the belief that AI can be a powerful partner in that thinking process.

Our goal is to create a tool that elevates the interaction with AI from a simple "code generator" to a sophisticated "thought partner."

## Future Epic: The Integrated AI Workflow Engine

As suggested by the user, a future evolution of this tool could be a fully integrated system that manages complex, multi-step interactions with the Gemini CLI.

### Core Concepts:
-   **Protocol:** Define a clear, machine-readable protocol for communication between the CLI and the Gemini agent. This would allow for structured data exchange beyond simple text prompts.
-   **Background Process:** The CLI could spawn a background Gemini instance to maintain state and context over long-running, complex tasks.
-   **Heuristic-Based Workflows:** The tool could analyze the user's request and the state of the codebase to automatically trigger complex, pre-defined workflows. For example, a "new feature" request could automatically trigger a sequence of:
    1.  `--critique` prompt to validate the feature.
    2.  `--plan` prompt to create a development plan.
    3.  A loop of `--contextualize` and code generation prompts.
    4.  A final `--refine` prompt to ensure quality.
-   **Interactive Feedback:** The system would manage the back-and-forth, only prompting the user for input when human validation or decision-making is required.

This represents a shift from a simple "prompt scaffolder" to an "AI-powered development orchestrator." This will be considered after the initial set of prompt-generation features is complete.
